export const IOS_RULES = `
Predefined accessibility rules for iOS:
1) Use accessibilityLabel and accessibilityHint for controls and images.
2) Mark headings and important landmarks for VoiceOver ordering.
3) Ensure controls have sufficient touch targets and are reachable in a logical focus order.
4) Group related elements appropriately; use traits for buttons, headers, and images.
5) Provide literal labels/hints in code rather than referencing external resource files.
6) Maintain existing logic and layout; only add accessibility attributes.`;
